The comprehensive analysis of student performance data reveals meaningful insights into how demographic and lifestyle factors influence academic achievement. Key indicators such as gender, parental education, test preparation, and lunch type significantly impact student outcomes in Math, Reading, and Writing.

Students whose parents possess higher educational qualifications tend to perform better across all subjects, indicating a strong influence of educational background. Similarly, those who completed test preparation programs show marked improvements in their Reading and Writing scores. Gender-based trends reveal that while males generally excel in Math, females tend to outperform in Reading and Writing, suggesting the need for balanced subject support.

Lunch type emerges as a socio-economic indicator; students receiving standard lunch generally achieve higher scores, highlighting potential disparities linked to nutrition and access. Moreover, students engaged in regular physical activity or those who practice sports “regularly” tend to have slightly better performance, underscoring the value of a well-rounded lifestyle.

Visual tools like heatmaps, pairplots, and violin plots provided clarity in identifying correlations and patterns. This analysis offers actionable insights for educators and stakeholders to design targeted interventions, promote equal opportunities, and enhance overall student development.
